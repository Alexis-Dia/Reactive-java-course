Oleh tries to implement spec of Rx-programming example-by-example.
1. Example1 is about ordering of calling methods in 
   Here Oleh says about right order: 
       - in Publisher create Subscription
       - send to Subscriber -> Subscription: subscriber.onSubscribe(subscription);
       - send data: subscriber.onNext(data);
       - says to Subscriber that is finish: subscriber.onComplete();
2. Example2 (10:20) is about back pressure (backpressure). Backpressure - it's control of thread of data. Problem of 
    example1 is that data was came when we even didn't ask.
3. Example3 (12:30) is about checking null.
4. Example4 (13:50) is about recursion. Oleh uses pattern - work in progress.
5. Example5 is about subscription canceling.
    19:20 is about reactive-streams-tck. We have to add dependence and inherit from PublisherVerification-class. 
    This lib reactive-streams-tck uses for checking all 41 requirements of reactive-specification.
6. Example6 (24:20 - 36:50) is about multithreading.

Networking in Java with NIO and Netty — Konstantin Slisenko
1. Example11 is about simply ServerSocket server. For running use - telnet localhost 45000
2. Example12 is about some fixes for ServerSocket using multithreading. Every time when each connection comes in we will
 start it in separate thread. For running use - telnet localhost 45000
3. Example13 is about situation when LoadTestingClient opens 10000 connections.
4. Example13 is about using ThreadPool on server side and LoadTestingClient again opens 10000 connections. Using ExecutorService 
and ThreadPool we restricted number of thread on 200 items. Minus of this decision is that if 201 clint connect we wont
provide him a connection.
